;;; TODO: 1. Look into how Emacs enables transparency in Xorg and see if we can't apply such a
;;;       feature to Nyxt! Currently using Xorg's transset (hack)!
;;;       2. Look into customizing fonts...
;;;       3. Apply theme colors & fonts to Nyxt's internal editor...
;;;          Would like to work on this feature to help get Nyxt to where Emacs is, i.e. first
;;;          implement syntax highlighting!
;;;       4. Customize `edit-file' command/interface
;;;       5. TBD
